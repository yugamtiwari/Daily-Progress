1) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1481/C -- constructive question , observations based and implementation.. we can use vector as a stack as its pop_back o/p is O(1)
2) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1482/C -- pigeonhole principle approach can also be used where we say there can be atmost one friend with more than (m/2) appearance
3) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1476/D -- dynamic programming problem which can be solved by making observations; also can be modelled to graph theory and using dsu
