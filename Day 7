4) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1514/C -- good observation of gcd 
5) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1458/A -- easy number theoretic problem
6) https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/1295/C -- a good implementation based problem. Always prove your argument or atleast get a solid intuition and work it on a test case. Random guessing is not good.
